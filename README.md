# Proportional Species Richness Analysis
This repository contains an R project focused on examining proportional species richness using univariate analysis and fundamental R programming techniques. The project involves hypothesis testing, contingency table analysis for comparing categorical variables, and both simple and multiple linear regression. Additionally, it encourages open-ended analysis and exploration.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
R code.R â€“ Contains the R script with data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
R project description.pdf â€“ A detailed document outlining the project's objectives, methodology, and key findings.
